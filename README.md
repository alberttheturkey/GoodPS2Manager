# GoodPS2Manager
Software for managing your PS2 Library for use with OPL Manager

GoodPS2Manager is a work in Progress Management application aimed at allowing the user to manage their PS2 Library, rip and add PS2 image files to an OPL structured folder, download and store artwork for their games, and transfer those games between the PC and the PS2 as they see fit

It is currently a work in progress, at the moment it only supports creating the folder structure and adding the games to it on your local machine, more features are to come in the future
